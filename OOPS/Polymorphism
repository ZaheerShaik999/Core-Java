Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It's a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that promotes code flexibility and reusability.

There are two main types of polymorphism:

1. Method Overriding:

Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method inherited from its superclass.
The subclass's method replaces the superclass's method when called on an object of the subclass.
Enables you to customize the behavior of inherited methods based on the specific subclass.
2. Method Overloading:

Occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order). Â  
The compiler chooses the appropriate method based on the arguments passed during the method call.
Allows you to create methods with the same name but different functionalities.
Key Points:

Polymorphism is achieved through inheritance.
It enhances code readability and maintainability.
It allows you to write more generic and reusable code.
It's essential for designing flexible and extensible software.
